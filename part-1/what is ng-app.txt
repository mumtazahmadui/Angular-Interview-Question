Q.what is ng-app?
=> The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that this is the root element of the AngularJS application. All     AngularJS applications must have a root element. You can only have one ng-app directive in your HTML    document.
=>Use this directive to auto-bootstrap an AngularJS application. 
=>The ngApp directive designates the root element of the application and is typically placed near the root element of the page - e.g. on the <body> or <html> tags.

**keep in mind**
There are a few things to keep in mind when using ngApp:

=>only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document.
=>The first ngApp found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an    application.
=> To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using        angular.bootstrap instead.
=>AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.
